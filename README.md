# What's this about?

**KI University** initiative is all about knowledge-sharing, mentorship and empowering each other. It will act as a manifestation of the kind of values we strongly believe in at **[KI labs](https://ki-labs.com)**. 

For now, plan is to do it **bi-weekly on Thursdays 4 pm – 5 pm** unless we don’t have any speaker. Remember, this is the first iteration and things will improve as we learn what works and what not. 

Some basic guidelines: -

- This is not supposed to be limited to only “Tech/Engineering” topics.
- Everyone is equally encouraged specially the first-timers. We promise we won’t Judge :D
- Language would be English (No surprises here!)
- Ideally talks should take somewhere between 10 - 15 mins to keep it engaging and short enough to retain interest.
- Topic could be anything and not limited to: Any useful tool you would like to share, some challenging problem you solved, some cool research you read about or want to just share something inspirational. Anything and Everything is welcome but obviously something which is somewhat related to our work in general.
- You are not bound to have a slide but it’ll be nice to have one. We’ll find a way to publish them from KI labs account. The bottom-line is that you are prepared enough to convey the knowledge in an appropriate manner.
